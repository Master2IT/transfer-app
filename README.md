Work i did:

- Optimize project for mobile phones
- Add db.json inside project instead of using nodejs api
- use josn-server package to access db.json (Run server at the first => npm run server || yarn server)
- Change theme
- Fix bugs

You are now doesn't need to run nodejs server in another repository i sent it before with name "transfer-api" but if you need to run it with nodejs use v1 (v2 doesn't work with nodejs).
